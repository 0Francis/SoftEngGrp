EduBridge Platform
Project Overview

EduBridge is a digital platform developed for BrightFutures Youth Center to address the challenge of youth unemployment and skill gaps in the city. The system connects young people with relevant internships, volunteer opportunities, and skill-building programs while helping organizations identify suitable candidates for their programs.

The platform enables youth to create verified profiles, organizations to post structured opportunities, and administrators to oversee processes such as verification, reporting, and certification.
